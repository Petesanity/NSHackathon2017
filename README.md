This project was from the 2017 NSHackathon at Lehman College. The theme was diversity and empowerment. My team and I had the idea of creating a website that allows people who are completely new to computer science to find workshops and events going on around them as well as using resources from the website such as quizzes, daily tips, and a small shape building game that shows the fun side of programming. This code is imcomplete however we hope to complete it in the near future.
